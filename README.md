Take A Paws is a VS Code extension, built to support developers' mental health. Your little kitten friend will respond to how you are feeling: Happy 😄, Sad 😔, Angry 😤, Confused 🤔, and even Surprised 😲. If you are coding with confidence, the code companion cat will cheer you on and help you maximize your productivity! Feeling a little frustrated? Your fluffy feline friend will detect this through your keystroke patterns and facial expressions and will suggest you to take a short walk 🚶‍♂️ to clear your mind so you can get back to coding with confidence 💻! Take A Paws takes in your facial expressions in a sophisticated weighting algorithm to determine the best way to support you.
